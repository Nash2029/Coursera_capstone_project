    "I am a business analyst residing in Southbank Melbourne. I currently live within walking distance to Melbourne CBD and Flinders station and I enjoy many amenities and venues in the area, such as various international cuisine restaurants, cafes, shopping malls and entertainment. I currently work in a bank within walking distance to my home. However, I have been offered an opportunity to work for a leading consulting firm in Manhattan, NY. They will leverage my BA skills and newly acquired data science to help their business analytics team. I am unsure about taking the role and would like to use this opportunity to dedicate my final coursera project into investigating advantages and disadvatanges of taking this offer.The key question is : How much do I need to spend in comparison to Melbourne to find an apartment with my girl friend which is as convenient and affordable as mine in Melbourne, considering the salary difference. I can use available real estate websites and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Manhattan NY, I must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Manhattan must meet the following demands:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apartment must be 2 or 3 bedrooms\n",
    "Desired location is near a metro station in the Manhattan area and within (1.5 km) radius or less than 30 minutes walking distance.\n",
    "Price of rent not exceed $6,000 per month\n",
    "Top amenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence\n",
    "Desirable to have venues such as coffee shops, Asian and Japanese/Korean Restaurants, gym and Grocery stores nearby.\n",
    "As a reference, I have included a map of venues near current residence in Melbourne."

The same methodology can be applied in accordance to demands as applicable. This case is also applicable for anyone interested in exploring starting or locating a new business in any city. Lastly, it can also serve as a good practical exercise to develop Data Science skills."
